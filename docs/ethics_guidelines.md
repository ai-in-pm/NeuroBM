# Ethics Guidelines for NeuroBM

## Overview

NeuroBM is a research and educational platform for cognitive modeling using Boltzmann machines. This document establishes ethical guidelines for the responsible development, use, and distribution of this software.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Research Purpose Only
- **Primary Intent**: NeuroBM is designed exclusively for research and educational purposes
- **No Clinical Applications**: The software must never be used for clinical diagnosis, treatment, or medical decision-making
- **No Commercial Deployment**: Models should not be deployed in commercial applications without extensive validation

### 2. Transparency and Openness
- **Open Source**: All code is open source to enable scrutiny and collaboration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of methods, limitations, and assumptions
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments should be reproducible with provided configurations

### 3. Responsible AI Development
- **Bias Awareness**: Acknowledge and document potential biases in synthetic data generation
- **Limitation Disclosure**: Clearly communicate model limitations and uncertainties
- **Validation Requirements**: Emphasize the need for proper validation before any real-world application

## Specific Guidelines

### Data Ethics

#### Synthetic Data Use
- **Primary Data Source**: NeuroBM primarily uses synthetic data to avoid privacy concerns
- **Realistic Modeling**: Synthetic data should be realistic but clearly identified as artificial
- **No Real Patient Data**: Never use real patient data without proper IRB approval and consent

#### Data Privacy
- **Privacy by Design**: Implement privacy-preserving techniques from the start
- **Anonymization**: If real data is ever used, ensure proper anonymization
- **Consent**: Obtain explicit consent for any data use beyond synthetic generation

### Model Development Ethics

#### Bias and Fairness
- **Bias Documentation**: Document known biases in data generation and model behavior
- **Fairness Considerations**: Consider fairness implications across different populations
- **Inclusive Design**: Design models to be inclusive and avoid discriminatory outcomes

#### Validation and Testing
- **Rigorous Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for all model components
- **Cross-Validation**: Use proper cross-validation techniques for model evaluation
- **External Validation**: Encourage external validation by independent researchers

### Research Ethics

#### Publication and Sharing
- **Open Science**: Encourage open publication of research findings
- **Code Sharing**: Share code and configurations to enable replication
- **Negative Results**: Report negative results to prevent publication bias

#### Collaboration
- **Interdisciplinary Teams**: Encourage collaboration with domain experts
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with relevant stakeholders in research design
- **Community Input**: Seek input from affected communities when appropriate

## Usage Restrictions

### Prohibited Uses
1. **Clinical Diagnosis**: Never use for diagnosing mental health conditions
2. **Treatment Decisions**: Never use for making treatment recommendations
3. **Screening Tools**: Never use as screening tools for employment, insurance, etc.
4. **Surveillance**: Never use for monitoring or surveillance of individuals
5. **Discrimination**: Never use in ways that could discriminate against protected groups

### Required Disclaimers
All uses of NeuroBM must include clear disclaimers stating:
- Research/educational purpose only
- No clinical or diagnostic value
- Synthetic data limitations
- Need for proper validation
- Potential biases and limitations

## Governance Structure

### Ethics Review Board
- **Composition**: Researchers, ethicists, domain experts, community representatives
- **Responsibilities**: Review research proposals, assess ethical implications, provide guidance
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of project direction and impact

### Community Guidelines
- **Code of Conduct**: Establish clear community standards for interaction
- **Reporting Mechanisms**: Provide ways to report ethical concerns
- **Response Procedures**: Define procedures for addressing ethical issues

## Implementation Requirements

### For Researchers
1. **Ethics Training**: Complete relevant ethics training before using NeuroBM
2. **IRB Approval**: Obtain IRB approval for any research involving human subjects
3. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of research methods and findings
4. **Peer Review**: Subject research to appropriate peer review processes

### For Developers
1. **Ethical Review**: Submit code changes for ethical review when appropriate
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing including bias testing
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of code functionality and limitations
4. **Security**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect against misuse

### For Educators
1. **Context Setting**: Clearly establish educational context and limitations
2. **Critical Thinking**: Encourage critical thinking about AI ethics and limitations
3. **Responsible Use**: Model responsible use of AI tools in educational settings
4. **Awareness Building**: Build awareness of ethical issues in AI development

## Monitoring and Enforcement

### Regular Audits
- **Code Audits**: Regular audits of code for potential ethical issues
- **Usage Monitoring**: Monitor how the software is being used and cited
- **Impact Assessment**: Assess the broader impact of the project

### Violation Response
- **Investigation Process**: Clear process for investigating potential violations
- **Corrective Actions**: Range of corrective actions from education to access restriction
- **Appeals Process**: Fair appeals process for disputed violations

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Mechanisms
- **Community Input**: Regular solicitation of community feedback on ethical practices
- **Expert Consultation**: Ongoing consultation with ethics experts
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Regular engagement with affected stakeholders

### Guideline Updates
- **Regular Review**: Annual review of ethics guidelines
- **Adaptive Approach**: Willingness to adapt guidelines as technology and understanding evolve
- **Transparent Process**: Transparent process for updating guidelines

## Resources and Support

### Training Materials
- **Ethics Modules**: Develop training modules on AI ethics for users
- **Best Practices**: Compile and share best practices for responsible AI research
- **Case Studies**: Develop case studies illustrating ethical decision-making

### Support Systems
- **Ethics Consultation**: Provide access to ethics consultation for complex issues
- **Community Forums**: Maintain forums for discussing ethical issues
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of ethical considerations

## Conclusion

These ethics guidelines are living documents that will evolve with the project and the broader understanding of AI ethics. All contributors and users of NeuroBM are expected to uphold these principles and contribute to the responsible development and use of this technology.

The goal is not just to avoid harm, but to actively contribute to the beneficial development of AI for understanding human cognition while respecting human dignity, privacy, and autonomy.
